Awesome—here’s a **solid, ambitious Go-to-Market (GTM) plan** for TrustMeBro, with expert guidance and a step-by-step execution guide you can run immediately.

# 1) Objectives & Positioning (first 6–9 months)

**North Star:** become the *trust layer* for brand–creator deals (escrow + contract + auto-payout).

* **Targets:** 100 paying brands, 500 creators, **1,000 contracts**, **CHF 600k GMV**, **8–10% take-rate**, NPS ≥ 45.
* **Beachhead:** EU/CH SMB DTC brands in **sports/outdoor** (start with **golf**), working with **micro/mid creators** (1k–50k followers).
* **Core promise:** *“Both sides put money on the table. No ghosting. Guaranteed payout or refund rules.”*

# 2) ICPs & Offers

**ICP-A (Brands/SMBs):** DTC ecommerce (sports gear, cosmetics, gadgets), 5–50 collabs/quarter, owner/CMO runs influencer spend.

* **Value:** stop product loss, pay only when content is live, zero invoice chasing, dispute safety.
* **Offer:** 8–10% take-rate, **Stripe fees passed through**; **0% platform fee for first 3 contracts**; “auto-approve in 48h or creator gets paid”.

**ICP-B (Creators micro/mid):** 1k–50k followers on IG/TikTok/YT, do 3–10 brand deals/quarter.

* **Value:** funds secured upfront, guaranteed payout, simple contract, less admin.
* **Offer:** **instant payouts** (once live) + “**ghost-proof**” badge; fee credits for referrals.

# 3) Pricing & Monetization

* **Transaction fee (primary):** 8–10% (volume-tiered).
* **Pass-through PSP costs:** show fees transparently; discount for SEPA.
* **Brand plans (add-ons later):**

  * Pro (CHF 99/mo): dispute support, templates, team seats, priority payouts.
  * Plus (CHF 299/mo): API/export, account manager, roll-up reporting.

* Shopify/BigCommerce app directory listing (if feasible after MVP polish).

**B. Content & SEO (compounds)**

* Always retarget site visitors.

# 5) Sales Motions

**Self-serve + assisted:** brands can start a contract in 5 minutes; offer “Book a 15-min setup” for hand-holding.
**Mid-market agencies:** 30–45 min demo; pilot with 3 creators and 3 brands; monthly check-ins; expand to all clients.

**Outbound sequence (brands):**

1. Problem poke (product loss, unpaid content).
2. 2-line value (escrow + auto-approve).
3. 60-sec Loom of the flow.
4. Social proof/case (mini).
5. Last nudge + invite link (free 0% fee for 3 contracts).

# 6) Activation & Growth Loops

* **In-product invite loop:** brand invites creator via email link → both accounts created → fee credit when funded.
* **Badge loop:** “TrustMeBro Verified” mini-badge the creator can add to bio/post → drives inbound.
* **Template magnet:** downloadable contract template gated by email → nurture to first contract.
* **Two-sided referrals:** both sides earn credits on successful contracts.

# 7) Metrics & Targets (what to track weekly)

* Top: **GMV**, **Take-rate revenue**, **# Contracts**.
* Funnel: Brand signups → Contracts created → **Funded rate** → **Submitted** → **Released**.
* Time to first value: brand signup → first funded contract **≤14 days**.
* CAC & Payback: aim **< 3 months** on brand acquisition.
* Supply health: **active creators** / brand; **repeated brands** (% running ≥2 contracts).

# 8) 90-Day Execution Plan (week-by-week)

**Weeks 3–4 (Private beta)**

* Onboard **10 brands** (friends of friends + targeted outreach).
* Onboard **50 creators** (micro in golf/outdoor; use a referral bounty).
* Run **20–30 contracts** end-to-end (even small). Collect quotes + screenshots.

**Weeks 5–8 (Public beta)**

* Announce: LinkedIn + creator communities; publish 2 case studies.
* **Partnerships:** sign 2 agencies; give 0% platform fee for 30 days for their first 5 clients.

* **Bi-weekly:** partner check-ins, product roadmap review with market feedback.
* **Monthly:** cohort analysis, pricing experiments, case study publication.

# 10) Expert Advice (things that save months)

1. **Win a narrow vertical first.** Own “golf/outdoor UGC trust” → easier references.
2. **Sell outcomes, not features.** “No ghosting. Guaranteed payout.”
3. **Make the first contract effortless.** Pre-filled templates, suggested deposits, one-link invite.
4. **Show the money.** After first “Released” for a creator, offer “share your success” button (drives UGC + proof).
5. **Offer a pilot commitment.** For agencies/brands: “Run 3 contracts this month—0% platform fee.”
6. **Guard margins.** Pass Stripe fees, promote SEPA. Keep take-rate stable.
7. **Don’t build discovery marketplace yet.** Focus on trust infra; matching can wait.
8. **Catch fraud early.** Manual review for first payouts; rate-limit; keep dispute SLA tight (≤3 days).
9. **Anchor Swiss trust.** Badge and copy—this matters to EU brands.
