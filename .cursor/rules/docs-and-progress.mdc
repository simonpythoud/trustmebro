description: Source of truth and progress tracking enforcement
---

- Use `TrustMeBro.md` as the canonical high-level source for business goals, requirements, and technical direction.
- When relevant changes are requested or discovered (scope, requirements, flows, strategy), update `TrustMeBro.md` immediately to keep it current.
- Always check and update `progress.md`:
  - Add newly requested tasks under the appropriate sections and mark them [TODO].
  - When tasks are completed or partially completed, update to [DONE]/[PARTIAL] with a brief impact note.
  - Keep a concise history of achievements, deltas, and known issues.
- Before coding, scan `TrustMeBro.md` to align with goals/constraints; after meaningful changes (features, endpoints, jobs, flows), reflect status updates in `progress.md`.
- PR hygiene (when applicable):
  - Link to the exact sections updated in `TrustMeBro.md` and `progress.md`.
  - Mention any impact on KPIs or acceptance criteria when relevant.
- Style:
  - Preserve existing indentation/formatting in edited files.
  - Keep commit messages concise and imperative (e.g., "Add payout flow; update spec & progress").
